# Launch Posts

## Primary X Post

```text
I built Codex Relay: a private Telegram remote for Codex on your Mac.

Text the bot from your phone. Your Mac runs the local Codex app CLI and replies when the run finishes.

No hosted relay account. No fake instant-agent claims.

## Alternate Short

```text
Codex Relay turns Telegram into a phone remote for Codex on your Mac.

Your phone sends the task.
Your Mac runs the local Codex CLI.
Telegram gets the final answer back.

## VNC Angle

```text
I got tired of the "remote into my Mac from my phone" shape.

I don't want a tiny desktop. I want to text Codex:
"check this repo"
"look at this screenshot"
"inspect my automations"
"stop before posting/pushing"

So I built Codex Relay.

Telegram in. Local Codex CLI on the Mac. Telegram out.
```

## App Server Angle

```text
The PWA + app server route works, but then you own a tiny product.

Codex Relay is the smaller shape:
Telegram bot
local LaunchAgent
Codex app CLI
allowlisted user

No hosted relay account. No Cloudflare Access. No phone terminal.
```

## Romain/Team Reply Draft

```text
This is exactly the gap I tried to make small: not VNC, not a phone terminal, not a PWA/app-server product to maintain.

Telegram DM -> local LaunchAgent -> Codex app CLI on the Mac -> Telegram reply.

It supports screenshots/images, named threads, jobs/cancel/history, and a safe /automations path.

## First Reply

```text
Install:

git clone https://github.com/dicnunz/codex-relay.git
cd codex-relay
./scripts/install.sh

Then DM your bot:
/alive
/tools
/jobs
/automations
send a screenshot and ask what changed

Unofficial. Local-first. Uses your normal Codex/OpenAI account.
```

## Latency Reply

Use this if someone asks "how fast is it?" or "why does it take a while?":

```text
It is not trying to be instant chat. Telegram is just the remote; the Mac still starts the local Codex CLI, runs gpt-5.5 with xhigh reasoning, uses whatever tools the local runtime exposes, and sends the final reply back. A trivial probe on my Mac was about 5-6s. Real repo/browser/image tasks can take tens of seconds or minutes.
```

Short version:

```text
Same latency as a local Codex run, plus Telegram. Trivial gpt-5.5 xhigh probe was ~5s here; real tool work is usually tens of seconds or more.
```

## Comment Reply

Use this if someone asks what it actually is:

```text
It is a small Mac relay: Telegram DM in, local LaunchAgent runs Codex CLI, Telegram reply out. It does not host your tasks or pretend to be the official Codex app UI.
```

## Safety Reply

```text
The important boundary is the allowlist. Only the configured Telegram user/chat can call Codex, and the bot token/config stay local. Still, it is a path to Codex on your Mac, so use it only with a Telegram account and Mac you trust.
```

## Launch Checklist

- Use the generated demo video, not a raw UI accident.
- First frame must make the flow obvious: Telegram -> Codex CLI -> Mac.
- Keep the post plain. No "AGI", "always-on agent", "instant", or fake autonomy language.
- Reply with install commands.
- Keep the latency reply nearby.
- Pin the repo after posting.
- If asked, say plainly that it is unofficial and local-first.
- Do not imply OpenAI affiliation.
