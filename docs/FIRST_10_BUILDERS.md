# First 10 Builders

Goal: find the first install blocker, not collect compliments.

## Ask

Try Codex Mission Control on a Mac with Codex installed. Report the first thing that is confusing, broken, slow, or surprising.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dicnunz/codex-mission-control.git
cd codex-mission-control
./scripts/install.sh
```

Then run:

```bash
cmc status
cmc lanes
cmc packet
cmc dashboard
```

Optional Telegram path:

```bash
./cmc relay install
```

Then DM the bot:

```text
/mission status
/mission lanes
/mission packet
/health
/policy
```

## What To Report

- Mac model and macOS version
- Codex app or CLI state before install
- exact first blocker
- expected result
- short redacted output if useful

Do not paste bot tokens, `.env`, private screenshots, personal files, raw Codex transcripts, auth files, or unredacted logs.
