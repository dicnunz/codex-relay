# Official Launch Payload

## Primary X Post

```text
I built a Telegram remote for Codex on your Mac.

Text the bot. Your Mac runs the real Codex CLI locally and replies when the job is done.

No hosted relay. No new agent platform.

## First Reply

```text
Install:

git clone https://github.com/dicnunz/codex-relay.git
cd codex-relay
./scripts/install.sh

Then DM your bot:
/alive
/tools
send a screenshot and ask what changed
```

## If Someone Asks About Latency

```text
It is not instant chat. Telegram is just the remote; the Mac still starts Codex, runs the model, uses tools, and then sends the final reply back. Simple checks can be quick, but real repo/browser/image tasks often take tens of seconds or minutes. Default timeout is 10 minutes.
```

## Preflight

```bash
./scripts/doctor.sh
./scripts/status.sh
ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration,size assets/codex-relay-demo.mp4
git status --short --branch
```
